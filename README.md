# metarex.media website

This website was originally based on [Docsy] that is a [Hugo theme module]
for technical documentation sites, providing easy site navigation, structure,
and more.

The website is public domain so that you can add issues if you find errors in
the content or want to go back in time and find out what we changed. Some
downloads are hosted only on the website as they are too big for GitHub.
