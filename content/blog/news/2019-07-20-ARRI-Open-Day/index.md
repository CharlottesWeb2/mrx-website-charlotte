MXF-Live was demonstrated at the [ARRI International Broadcast Day 2019](https://www.arri.com/en/solutions/broadcast/broadcast-day-2019).

## Live Metadata Capture and Rendering in MXF

This 2 year project was a pre-cursor to **[metarex]**

![International Broadcast Demo Day{ class="ui medium left floated image" }](international-broadcast-day-2019-demo.jpg)

Ideal for semi-custom metadata such as position,  logging, device parameters
**Shoot** with on-set metadata from devices and from humans<br>
**Wrap** the metadata in MXF using open standards<br>
**Move** the video, audio and metadata over a standard IP network<br>
**Store** the stream as an open MXF file with enhanced metadata<br>
**Share** the content live and in files environments re-wrapping

<a id="what" style="float:none;clear:both;">&nbsp;</a>

### What is it?

An existing open standard for transporting containers of synchronous metadata over
IP networks for use in both live and file environments.

An [Arri] Camera and Head sent MXF containers over IP. These were multiplexed with
Metadata from the [Trackmen] system that gather pan, tilt, yaw, zoom, position, 
and lens metadata. [Nablet] software managed MXF multiplexing and demultiplexing
as well as serialising the MXF from the network into a file that could be
opened in Avid.

<a id="why" ></a>

### Why?

Many productions have rich metadata such as lens information, gimble telemetry, camera position information, shot logging and other bulky metadata that is created. The workflows to get it into the show are often ad-hoc. This project uses open standards to preserve metadata in a way that minimises re-wrap and re-engineering the data.

<a id="who" ></a>

### Who?

Led by **[Arri]**, the team included **[Nablet]**, **[Trackmen]**, **[Fusionmedia]** and **[Mr MXF]** as coordinator. What's Next? The system works and we're looking for partners to develop a framwework for handling any kind of metadata. See the [metarex] website for details
