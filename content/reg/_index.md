The {{% metarex %}} register will be delivered as an Open Source repository. You
can run is locally so that your secret squirrel production is invisible outside
your firewall, or you can use the public server (this one) which will be free
for the duration of the project. We are looking for a partner to be a long term
host for the register that is able to keep costs free or low, yet provide a
resilient service with high performance. [Contact](/contact) us if you think you
can fulfil this role.
